# Overview

This repository contains codes for text classification projects by machine learning and deep learning techniques. These projects focus on utilizing various datasets, such as IMDB, for training and evaluating text classification models. The goal is to classify text data into predefined categories or labels, with an emphasis on understanding and comparing the performance of different models on diverse datasets.

# Introduction

Text classification is a natural language processing (NLP) task where the goal is to assign predefined categories or labels to text data automatically. These projects explore the application of machine learning and deep learning methods for text classification, utilizing datasets like IMDB, for training and testing.

# Datasets

These projects leverage various data based on Kaggle datasets, including but not limited to:

    IMDB: A dataset of movie reviews with binary sentiment labels (positive/negative).
    CoronavirusTweets
    Emotions dataset for NLP : Collection of documents and its emotions, It helps greatly in NLP Classification tasks 
    E-commerce Text classification: A dataset based on Electronics, Household, Books, Clothing and accessories, covers 80%.
    SMS spam: It includes  a set of SMS-tagged messages that have been collected for SMS Spam research.
    Emotion Detection
    Medical Text Dataset

# Prerequisites

Before running the code, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

    Python (version 3.6 or later)
    Pip (package installer for Python)
    Virtualenv (optional but recommended)
